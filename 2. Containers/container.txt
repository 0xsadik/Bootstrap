Containers:

    Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

How they work:>

Containers are the most basic layout element in bootstrap and are 'required when using our default grid system.'
Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

    0> .container (which sets a 'max-width' at each responsive brakpoint)
    0> .container-{breakpoint} (which is 'width:100%' until the specified breakpoint)
    0> .container-fluid (which is 'width: 100%' at all breakpoints)

--> some of them:

    .container 
    .container-sm 
    .container-md 
    .container-lg 
    .container-xl
    .container-xxl 
    .container-fluid 


--> Default container 

    <div class="container">
    <!-- Content here -->
    </div>


--> Responsive container

    <div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
    <div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
    <div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
    <div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
    <div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>

--> Fluid container

    <div class="container-fluid">
    ...
    </div>
